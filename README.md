# Microservices
This project is where I'm applying what I've learned about microservices and Spring-related technologies. I'm using Spring Boot to build a system with microservices architecture, incorporating tools and concepts like Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and API Gateway security. 
Each update demonstrates my progress, including service communication, message-driven architecture, and securing APIs.
